# Chapter 1 - Introduction

## Internet History:
**1972-1980: Inter-networking, new and proprietary nets**.
- 1970: ALOHAnet satellite network in Hawaii.
- 1974: Cref and Kahn - architecture for interconnecting networks.
- 1976: Ethernet at Xerox PARC.
- late 70's: proprietary architectures: DECnet, SNA, XNA.
- late 70's: switching fixed length packets (ATM precursor).
- 1979: ARPAnet has 200 nodes.
- **Notes**:
  - Cref and Khan's inter-networking principles:
    - minimalism, autonomy - no internal changes required to interconnect networks.
    - best effort service model.
    - stateless routers.
    - decentralized control.
  - Define today's internet architecture.

**1980-1990: new protocols, a proliferation of networks**.
- 1983: deployment of TCP/IP.
- 1982: smtp e-mail protocol defined.
- 1983: DNS defined for name-to-IP-address translation.
- 1985: ftp protocol defined.
- 1988: TCP congestion control.
- New national networks:
  - CSnet, BITnet, NSFnet, Minitel.
- 100,000 hosts connected to the confederation of networks.

**1990, 2000's: commercialization, the Web, new apps**.
- early 1990's: ARPAnet decommissioned.
- 1991: NSF lifts restrictions on commercial use of NSFnet (decommissioned, 1995).
- early 1990s: Web
  - hypertext [Bush 19545, Nelson 1960's].
  - HTML, HTTP: Berners-Lee.
  - 1994: Mosaic, later Netscape.
  - late 1990's: commercialization of the web.
- late 1990's - 2000's:
  - more killer apps: instant messaging, P2P file sharing.
  - network security to the forefront.
  - est. 50 millions host, 100 million+ users.
  - backbone links running at Gbps.

**2005 - present: scale, SDN, mobility, cloud**.
- aggressive deployment of broadband home access (10-100's Mbps).
- 2008: software-defined networking (SDN).
- increasing ubiquity of high-speed wireless access: 4G/5G, Wi-Fi.
- service providers (Google, Microsoft) create their own networks.
  - bypass internet, providing "instantaneous" access to search, video content, email, etc.
- e-commerce, universities, enterprises running their services in "cloud" (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure).
- rise of smartphones: more mobile than fixed devices on the internet (2017).
- ~15B devices attached to the internet (2023, statista.com).
