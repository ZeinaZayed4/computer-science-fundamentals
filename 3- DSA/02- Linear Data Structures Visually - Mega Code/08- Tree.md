# Tree

- A tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, where there's exactly one path between any two nodes.
- **Node:**
  - The fundamental units of a tree, each containing a value or data and potentially references to other nodes.
- **Edges:**
  - The links or connections between nodes, representing the relationships between them.
- **Root:**
  - The topmost node in a tree, which has no parent.
  - There's only one root in a tree.
- **Parent:**
  - A node that has one or more child nodes connected to it.
- **Child:**
  - A node connected to a parent node, located at a lower level in the hierarchy.
- **Leaf (or external node):**
  - A node that doesn't have any child nodes.
- **Internal Node:**
  - A node that has at least one child node.
- **Subtree:**
  - A portion of a tree that itself forms a tree, consisting of a node and all its descendants.
- **Path:**
  - A sequence of nodes and edges from one node to another.
- **Depth of a Node:**
  - The number of edges from the root node to that specific node.
- **Height of a Node:**
  - The number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf in its subtree.
- **Height of a Tree:**
  - The height of the root node.
