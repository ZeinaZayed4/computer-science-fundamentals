# Why Data Structures?

- Any program consists of:
  - Data.
  - Instructions (code).

- CPU takes a copy of the code and data from the storage into memory to execute the program.

- If date in the memory is stored inefficiently, the program will run slowly.

- Some data must be stored in a specific order, e.g., Arrays.

- **A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in memory to enable efficient access and modification**.
