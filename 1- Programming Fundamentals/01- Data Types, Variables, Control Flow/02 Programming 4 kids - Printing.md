# Recall C++ Program Life Cycle:

1. Write the code.
2. Compile it:
   - Compiler: Is there any compile errors? If no, Generates a program.
3. Run the program (executable):
   - Any run-time errors? If yes, stop.

- Error types:
  - Compiler error:
    - You violated the language syntax rule.
  - Run time error:
    - Good syntax, but program crashes due to error.
    - Example:
      - Divide by zero.
  - Examples of them in next lecture.

# 2 ways to add new line:

1. Use endl.
2. Or \n.

# Don't write after return line:

- return 0 tells the compiler we are done.
- Lines after it are ignored.

# Code comments: Using //:

- Anything in same line after // will not be executed.
- So comment what you want when you need so.

# Code comments: Using /\* \*/:

- If tou have many consecutive lines and won't compiler ignore, put them between /\* \*/.

# Numbers:

- int.
- double.

# Math on numbers:

- Will be shown in the code.

# What is the run-time output?

- Pass over the code line by line.
- Execute the line.
